A number of the flags are composed of two sets of color configurations, green, yellow and red or red, and black and green that are both referred to as ‘Pan-African colors’. The first set of colors were inspired by the flag of Ethiopia, the only country which saw a brief period of European occupation that ended in 1942 with the defeat of the Kingdom of Italy (1861-1945), but remained independent during the colonial era.",
