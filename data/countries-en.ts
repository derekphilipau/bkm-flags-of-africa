Many Black British loyalists relocated to Freetown after the American Revolution, and many freed former slaves were taken across the Atlantic by British ships after the slave trade was abolished in 1807. Britain took Freetown as a colony in 1808 and its surroundings in 1896. Following World War II, nationalist pressure forced the British government to introduce democratic institutions, eventually resulting in the establishment of the independent Dominion of Sierra Leone, which later became the Republic of Sierra Leone in 1971. Between 1991 and 2002, a brutal civil war killed 50,000 people and displaced more than two million. After decades of violence, Sierra Leone has held democratic elections since 1998, resulting in substantial economic growth.',

Even after abolition, colonial-era laws prohibiting Black Angolans from forming political parties or labor unions and requiring Black Angolan men to pay an imposto indígena (native tax) bolstered a system of unpaid, coerced labor. A rise in labor activism in 1960 shifted into a twelve-year war of independence that ended with the collapse of Portugal’s Estado Novo regime. Following independence in 1975, Angola became a one-party state rooted in Marxist-Leninist principles.',
