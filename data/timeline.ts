    text: 'Positioned along key trade routes between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, Cape Verde had been claimed by the Portuguese since the fifteenth century, before which the islands had been uninhabited. A number of factors—famine, epidemics, and the rise of Pan-Africanism on the mainland—led to the Cape Verdean independence movement. In 1956, alongside other activists, Amílcar Cabral, a trained agricultural engineer, founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Quickly, the party became the basis of both Guinea and Cape Verde’s independence movements and eventually waged armed rebellions against the Portuguese in 1961. More than a decade later, PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of Portuguese troops. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973, and two years later, Cape Verde was granted independence by the Portuguese.',

    text: 'The territory that is now Angola was colonized by the Portuguese in 1484, when explorer Diogo Cão established a trading post at the mouth of the Congo River. Portuguese settlements and outposts were established along the Angolan coast, mainly for the purpose of enslaving and trading Indigenous Angolans, a practice that continued into the early nineteenth century. Even after abolition, colonial-era laws prohibiting Black Angolans from forming political parties or labor unions and requiring Black Angolan men to pay an imposto indígena (native tax) bolstered a system of unpaid, coerced labor. A rise in labor activism in 1960 shifted into a twelve-year war of independence that ended with the collapse of Portugal’s Estado Novo regime. Following independence in 1975, Angola became a one-party state rooted in Marxist-Leninist principles.',
