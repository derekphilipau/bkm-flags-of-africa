A number of factors—famine, epidemics, and the rise of Pan-Africanism on the mainland—led to the Cape Verdean independence movement. In 1956, alongside other activists, Amílcar Cabral, a trained agricultural engineer, founded the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Quickly, the party became the basis of both Guinea and Cape Verde’s independence movements and eventually waged armed rebellions against the Portuguese in 1961. More than a decade later, PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of Portuguese troops. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973, and two years later, Cape Verde was granted independence by the Portuguese.',

Even after abolition, colonial-era laws prohibiting Black Angolans from forming political parties or labor unions and requiring Black Angolan men to pay an imposto indígena (native tax) bolstered a system of unpaid, coerced labor.
